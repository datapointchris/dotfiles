## Theme

* How does this apply into neovim.
* It seems that maybe the status bar is not updated completely
* I wonder if it would be better to have some type of template for tmux that the color names get filled in like STATUS_ACTIVE_WINDOW or something and then those are referenced.
* * TODO: Find out about the variables with @ since they are used elsewhere.
* I don't like half of the tmux.conf living somewhere else, because then I can never see the whole file.
* What about other programs and incorporating it with ghostty
*

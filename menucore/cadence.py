"""Cadence parsing and due-date math shared by the review register and labs.

A cadence token is ``<n><unit>`` — ``2w`` / ``1mo`` / ``10d`` / ``1y`` (a bare
number means days). The due date is always derived, never stored:
``next_due = last_done + cadence``. Storing only ``last_done`` means there is no
second date to keep in sync and nothing to drift.

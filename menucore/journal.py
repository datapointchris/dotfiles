"""Append-only event journal, one file per machine, merged on read.

The counterpart to :mod:`menucore.state`, and the reason it exists separately:
``state.py`` holds a small map that is rewritten whole, so losing a version costs
one date that the next ``done`` restores. A journal is the record that cannot be
reconstructed, and it is written from every machine, so it cannot share that
exposure.

The exposure is Syncthing's, and it is worth stating precisely because the fix
looks arbitrary otherwise. Syncthing resolves conflicts **per file, not per line** —
it mirrors files, it does not merge text the way git does. When two machines each
hold a version of one file the other has not seen, newest-modification wins and the
loser is set aside whole as ``.sync-conflict-<date>-<device>``, unread. For an
append-only log that divergence is not a rare race but the ordinary shape of a day:
log something on the laptop, close the lid before it syncs, log something at the
desktop, reopen the laptop, and one side loses its entire tail.

So every machine appends only to its own file, named for its bare hostname. No two
devices ever hold divergent versions of the same file, Syncthing has nothing to
resolve, and reads take the union. At a handful of entries a day the merge is
microseconds and the log stays greppable, which is why this is JSONL rather than
the SQLite the fleet standard would otherwise call for.

Records are self-describing: each carries its own ``schema_version``, because files
written by machines running different versions of the tool end up merged in one
read.

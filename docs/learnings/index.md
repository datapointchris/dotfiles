# Learnings

Concise lessons learned from dotfiles development. Each learning captures a specific bug, gotcha, or best practice worth remembering.

Browse learnings in the sidebar navigation. Each focuses on a single problem and solution.

## Format

Learnings follow a concise format (30-50 lines):

1. **Problem**: What went wrong
2. **Solution**: How to do it correctly
3. **Key Learnings**: Bullet points of actionable wisdom
4. **Testing**: Brief example (optional)
5. **Related**: Links to other learnings

## Adding Learnings

Create new learning in `docs/learnings/` when you discover something worth remembering.

Target 30-50 lines total - if longer, it belongs in main documentation not learnings.

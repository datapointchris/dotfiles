# Theme Sync

Base16 theme management across tmux, bat, fzf, eza, and shell via tinty. Change your theme once and watch it propagate everywhere simultaneously.

## Quick Start

```bash
theme-sync current           # Show current theme
theme-sync apply base16-rose-pine
theme-sync favorites         # List 12 favorite themes
theme-sync random            # Apply random favorite
theme-sync verify            # Check system status
```

## Commands

### Viewing

- `theme-sync current` - Show currently active theme
- `theme-sync list` - List all available Base16 themes (hundreds)
- `theme-sync favorites` - Show curated list of 12 favorite themes
- `theme-sync info <theme>` - Display color palette for a theme

### Applying Themes

- `theme-sync apply <theme>` - Switch to a specific Base16 theme
- `theme-sync random` - Apply random theme from favorites
- `theme-sync reload` - Reload theme in running applications

Applying a theme triggers tinty to generate new config files, then automatically reloads tmux config and rebuilds bat cache. Changes appear immediately without manual intervention.

### System

- `theme-sync verify` - Check that tinty is installed, configs exist, and theme files are present

## Favorite Themes

The 12 curated favorites balance variety with quality:

**Rose Pine family** - Warm, low-contrast:

- base16-rose-pine
- base16-rose-pine-moon

**Gruvbox family** - High-contrast retro:

- base16-gruvbox-dark-hard
- base16-gruvbox-dark-medium

**Modern themes**:

- base16-kanagawa (warm, earthy)
- base16-oceanicnext (cool blues)
- base16-github-dark (familiar GitHub colors)
- base16-nord (arctic blues)

**Specialized**:

- base16-selenized-dark (balanced contrast)
- base16-everforest-dark-hard (forest greens)
- base16-tomorrow-night (classic neutral)
- base16-tomorrow-night-eighties (nostalgic pastels)

These themes match the themes configured in Neovim and Ghostty for consistency across tools.

## How It Works

Theme-sync wraps tinty, which applies Base16 themes by generating application-specific config files. When you apply a theme, tinty writes new configs and theme-sync handles reloading affected applications.

### Application Integration

**Tmux** sources `~/.config/tmux/themes/current.conf` generated by tinty. Theme-sync automatically reloads tmux config after applying themes.

**Bat** uses themes from its themes directory. Theme-sync rebuilds bat cache after applying themes so syntax highlighting updates immediately.

**Fzf** sources theme variables from shell environment. New shells pick up theme changes automatically.

**Eza** uses LS_COLORS updated by tinty.

**Shell** sources theme variables exported by tinty for prompt and other colors.

### Configuration

Tinty reads `~/.config/tinty/config.toml` which defines Base16 scheme repositories. Theme-sync doesn't modify tinty config - it uses tinty as-is.

Favorite themes are hardcoded in `apps/common/theme-sync`. Edit the FAVORITES array directly:

```bash
nvim ~/dotfiles/apps/common/theme-sync
# Edit FAVORITES array
```

Changes apply immediately since shell scripts run directly.

## Integration with Ghostty

Theme-sync works alongside the separate ghostty-theme system. Ghostty uses its own theme format and manages 60+ built-in themes independently from Base16. This separation provides flexibility - you can keep them synchronized or intentionally separate for visual distinction.

Check both systems:

```bash
ghostty-theme current          # Check Ghostty theme
theme-sync current             # Check Base16 theme
```

Keep them synchronized:

```bash
ghostty-theme apply rose-pine
theme-sync apply base16-rose-pine
```

## Workflow

Switch themes based on mood or time of day:

```bash
theme-sync apply base16-rose-pine-moon    # Evening
theme-sync apply base16-github-dark       # Daytime
```

Break out of visual monotony with random selection:

```bash
theme-sync random
# Work for a bit, see how it feels
theme-sync random
# Try another
```

Combine with fzf for interactive selection:

```bash
theme-sync favorites | fzf --preview 'theme-sync info {}' | xargs theme-sync apply
```

Automate theme changes based on time:

```bash
hour=$(date +%H)
if [ $hour -ge 6 ] && [ $hour -lt 18 ]; then
  theme-sync apply base16-github-dark
else
  theme-sync apply base16-rose-pine
fi
```

## Troubleshooting

**Theme not applying**: Run `theme-sync verify` to check system status. Verify tinty is installed and theme repositories are downloaded with `tinty list`.

**Tmux not updating**: Check theme file exists at `~/.config/tmux/themes/current.conf`. Manually reload with `tmux source-file ~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf`.

**Bat not updating**: Rebuild cache manually with `bat cache --build`.

**Theme doesn't exist**: Run `theme-sync list` to see available themes. Update tinty schemes with `tinty update`.

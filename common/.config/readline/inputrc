## Config file for GNU readline, command line util ##
# This file controls the behaviour of line input editing for
# programs that use the GNU Readline library.  Existing
# programs include FTP, Bash, and GDB.

# Include system inputrc file
$include /etc/inputrc

# Make Tab autocomplete regardless of filename case
set completion-ignore-case on

# List all matches in case multiple possible completions are possible
set show-all-if-ambiguous on

# Immediately add a trailing slash when autocompleting symlinks to directories
set mark-symlinked-directories on

# Show all autocomplete results at once
set page-completions off

# If there are more than 200 possible completions for a word, ask to show them all
set completion-query-items 200

#

# Display possible completions in color to indicate file types
set colored-stats on

# Show extra file information when completing, like `ls -F` does
set visible-stats on

# sets the completions to be listed immediately instead of ringing the bell,
# when the completing word has more than one possible completion
# but no partial completion can be made.
set show-all-if-unmodified on

# Be more intelligent when autocompleting by also looking at the text after
# the cursor. For example, when the current line is "cd ~/src/mozil", and
# the cursor is on the "z", pressing Tab will not autocomplete it to "cd
# ~/src/mozillail", but to "cd ~/src/mozilla". (This is supported by the
# Readline used by Bash 4.)
set skip-completed-text on

# Allow UTF-8 input and output, instead of showing stuff like $'\0123\0456'
